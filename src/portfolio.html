          <p>I had an idea roaming in my head for a while about wanting to paint a mystic creature in an ambiguous setting. As a kid, I always drew (or rather doodled) monsters without any motive than just "I just think they're cool :)". This painting is partially in homage to those times. I also wanted to fulfill a personal wish from all those years to make a full on illustration when my skills were ripe and capable to render such a feat.</p>

    <p>Personal vent on having insecurities as a trans dude. It's not only an "insecurity" but thoughts that after thinking for a while, can eat me away.</p> 
    <p>I may not sound like a "man", I may not dress in anything but a loose shirt, or use much else like a tank top from not having to expose feminine parts of my body.

I do not want to talk or bring up how I was born a woman. This is about a personal journey into becoming who I really identify as and I no longer want to remember who I was born as.</p>

    <p>“The Renaissance Artist”, 2019</p>
    <p>There's two things that were new to me while making this: Anime and Historical time period (1550s). While successfully illustrating both those things in the end, I really wasn't ready to search up the exact time era with how easels, self portraits and even clothing looked at the time along with trying a whole different style (*cough* *cough* anime). The way anime illustrations are done was the most interesting experience to learn. Not only that but the hardest thing out of all of this was creating the sea water. I don't know how I did it but it was a lot of trial and error with this one."</p>

    <p>So I did a mini project with trying to imagine an Alaskan Bull Worm in real life. :)</p>
    <p>The process with designing the Alaskan Bull Worm wasn't as difficult but I did had to learn a little bit about worms and their physiology. So after getting some references, I got into work with interpreting the iconic worm. Honestly the hardest part about this painting was trying to create the sandy aquascape. I tried making the sand texture as objective as well as adding some aqua stuff seen in Spongebob (blue rocks, the corals, etc.)</p>

    <p>Having a fascination with geometry, I once came across "sacred geometry" which brought me into a rabbit hole for these beautiful and intricate patterns.
