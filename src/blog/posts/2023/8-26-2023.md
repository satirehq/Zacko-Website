title: I don't have a word to describe myself or my aesthetics, so I went onto aesthetics wiki for help

So…… This wasn’t planned at all and it was thanks to a wandering thought to myself I’ve asked more than once, “Wait how would I describe my aesthetic? What word or term can describe my self expression, attitude or personality? Is there any patterns from my art or clothing for example that screams a certain genre?” And with this in mind, I decided the day finally came and I did what everyone does with a burning question: look it up online and see what the first results offer. I came across a website called the <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki">Aesthetics Wiki</a> which seemed promising. Because I’m lazy as shit, this is how the front page of the website describes itself: *“We are a community dedicated to the identification, observation, and documentation of visual schemata.”*

So perfect reflection to my personal criteria of what I’m looking for! Let’s go from here, except now I have a daunting ***981*** pages to go through (though it’s really less as this number includes other miscellaneous pages such as their FAQ, a glossary and a tutorial on how to format a specified aesthetic article. So….. yay for less work? ***I guess.*** ಠ_ಠ

**But anyhow, I’m looking for articles that are close enough to these labels I usually throw at myself or fond of:**
  <ul class="list">
    1. Acting childish/having a sense of childish character (just as a way of being happy or cheery)

    2. Fondness of artisan or hand crafted items

    3. Earth/neutral tones tinted with brown

    4. (In relation to the top listing) Fondness of anything “antique” (broadly using that word, don’t come at me for not specifying the era)

    5. Victorian era enthusiast

    6. Fan of warm cozy settings such as a warmly-lit bedroom

    7. Small rooms in general (so think of a bungalow)

    8. 2000s cartoons (or just western kids cartoons)

    9. Quiet settings

    10. Houses or places just in the middle of a field, almost as if you’re a character starting out on an adventure

    11. Grimdark/the macabre (I blame Courage the Cowardly Dog and The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy for making that look cool and appealing, along with the introducing a slice of life scenarios with monsters and a dark twist)
      
  </ul>

Not a bad list of things to off of, now to get through the grueling number of pages with different terms and definitions in hopes of one or more resonating with me.

......

(After a little bit of my day going through every page entry) Alrighty, let’s get the drum roll for what the results are!

**The winner for Aesthetic most reflective of me:** <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Twee">Twee</a>

Checks out a lot of the things I described myself such as being childish and having a fondness of an unspecified era of vintage items. Color palette associated with Tween also checks out too (“home-y shades of tan and brown”). Man I love this way more than I should have and I’m happy I came across it!
      
**Runner-ups for labels I can also agree with:**<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/I-Spy"> I-Spy</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Tinkercore">Tinkercore</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Miscellaneous_Academia">Miscellaneous academia</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Soft_Colonial_Wanderlust">Soft Colonial Wanderlust</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite">Pre-Raphaelite</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Doodlecore">Doodlecore</a>

**Labels that I partially resonate with or like the idea of:** <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Phony_Bureaucracy">Phony Bureaucracy (I REALLY love the concept of this)</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pop_Art"> Pop Art (the vintage comicbook style and ethos of my imagination is basically my website)</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Gloomcore">Gloomcore</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Salvagepunk">Salvagepunk</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Hydrogen">Hydrogen</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Retro-Futurism">Retro-Futurism</a></p>

In conclusion: I honestly thought there wasn't going to be anything that would tick off more than three of my descriptions but this wiki surpassed my expectations! :)
