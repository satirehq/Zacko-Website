      <p>Hi I'm Zackary, a catch of all trades kinda nerd that decided to code an entire website to stash not only my art but also anything else that intruigues me. I've been on the internet since the early 2000s as a kid, and seeing the types of people come and go over the many years has brought me an interesting mental collection of how the world wide web's evolved. At least we're finally past the days of when someone used to send an unsuspecting person a random link and taking them to a screamer or shock site with a possbility of catching a virus in the process (thank God). I digress though. Mostly what I did across the early internet was browse on youtube for cartoon clips, pokemon and naruto related content, how-to videos and comdey skits by youtubers such as nigahiga and smosh. I also did some gaming here and there on flash games sites such as nitome and armor games (plus the hundreds of now defunct obscure websites that just had a copy of the more popular games by bigger sites lol).</p>
      <p>At some point, I started using the internet as a platform and tool for my life long passion of drawing which still holds up to this day. The rest is history. Other things I can say about myself is that (whether or not it's surprising to you) I am transgender and autistic, going by he/him pronouns with a preference of being in a quiet place full of a handful of people instead of a loud crowd filled in the 100s or 1000s. Oh yeah, did I mention I like to draw? :D (No shit) Traditional art butters my croissant, and art coming from eras such as the Italian Renaissance and the 19th Century Realism butters gives me inspiration. Ironically, I try to replicate that as much as possible through digital means with a porgram I currently use called Rebelle. Although not perfect, it does the general jist of what I'm looking for.</p>
      <p>I tend to pick up different hobbies over the years and lose interest soon after, with some having stuck with me even if I don't actively engage in them: Coding (ha), DIY projects, 3D printing, sewing, origami (this one goes all the way back from my childhood. God bless origami youtube tutorials), and insert one of every type of arts and crafts medium.</p>
