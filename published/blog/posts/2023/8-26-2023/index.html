        <br>
          <p>So…… This wasn’t planned at all and it was thanks to a wandering thought to myself I’ve asked more than once, “Wait how would I describe my aesthetic? What word or term can describe my self expression, attitude or personality? Is there any patterns from my art or clothing for example that screams a certain genre?” And with this in mind, I decided the day finally came and I did what everyone does with a burning question: look it up online and see what the first results offer. I came across a website called the <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki">Aesthetics Wiki</a> which seemed promising. Because I’m lazy as shit, this is how the front page of the website describes itself: <em>“We are a community dedicated to the identification, observation, and documentation of visual schemata.”</em></p>
<p>So perfect reflection to my personal criteria of what I’m looking for! Let’s go from here, except now I have a daunting <em><strong>981</strong></em> pages to go through (though it’s really less as this number includes other miscellaneous pages such as their FAQ, a glossary and a tutorial on how to format a specified aesthetic article. So….. yay for less work? <em><strong>I guess.</strong></em> ಠ_ಠ</p>
<p><strong>But anyhow, I’m looking for articles that are close enough to these labels I usually throw at myself or fond of:</strong>
<ul class="list">
1. Acting childish/having a sense of childish character (just as a way of being happy or cheery)</p>
<p>2. Fondness of artisan or hand crafted items</p>
<p>3. Earth/neutral tones tinted with brown</p>
<p>- (In relation to the top listing) Fondness of anything “antique” (broadly using that word, don’t come at me for not specifying the era)</p>
<p>- Victorian era enthusiast</p>
<p>- Fan of warm cozy settings such as a warmly-lit bedroom</p>
<p>- Small rooms in general (so think of a bungalow)</p>
<p>- 2000s cartoons (or just western kids cartoons)</p>
<p>- Quiet settings</p>
<p>- Houses or places just in the middle of a field, almost as if you’re a character starting out on an adventure</p>
<p>- Grimdark/the macabre (I blame Courage the Cowardly Dog and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy for making that look cool and appealing with the introduction of monsters and dark twists to everyday life)</p>
<p></ul></p>
<p>Not a bad list of things to off of, now to get through the grueling number of pages with different terms and definitions in hopes of one or more resonating with me.</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>(After a little bit of my day going through every page entry) Alrighty, let’s get the drum roll for what the results are!</p>
<p><strong>The winner for Aesthetic most reflective of me:</strong> <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Twee">Twee</a></p>
<p>Checks out a lot of the things I described myself such as being childish and having a fondness of an unspecified era of vintage items. Color palette associated with Tween also checks out too (“home-y shades of tan and brown”). Man I love this way more than I should have and I’m happy I came across it!</p>
<p><strong>Runner-ups for labels I can also agree with:</strong><a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/I-Spy"> I-Spy</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Tinkercore">Tinkercore</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Miscellaneous_Academia">Miscellaneous academia</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Soft_Colonial_Wanderlust">Soft Colonial Wanderlust</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite">Pre-Raphaelite</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Doodlecore">Doodlecore</a></p>
<p><strong>Labels that I partially resonate with or like the idea of:</strong> <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Phony_Bureaucracy">Phony Bureaucracy (I REALLY love the concept of this)</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pop_Art"> Pop Art (the vintage comicbook style and ethos of my imagination is basically my website)</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Gloomcore">Gloomcore</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Salvagepunk">Salvagepunk</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Hydrogen">Hydrogen</a>, <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Retro-Futurism">Retro-Futurism</a></p></p>
<p>In conclusion: I honestly thought there wasn't going to be anything that would tick off more than three of my descriptions but this wiki surpassed my expectations! :)</p>
